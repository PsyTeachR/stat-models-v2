## Why models?



### Models versus tests

Models can be used in simulation. Having a model make s

### Models of measurement

observation = truth + error

### Assessing model fit

### Comparing models

This textbook takes a 'modeling' approach toward psychological/neuroscientific data. 

Often a survey course on psychology will present the content as a set of recipes 

This first chapter provides an overview of the textbook and an explanation of and rationale for the general approach. 

## Models versus tests

My approach in this course is to 

## Common types of data

[:dependent variable](glossary.qmd#dependent-variable)

### Multilevel data

Psychological data is often [:multilevel](glossary.qmd#multilevel). Blah blah blah.

Here the focus is on behavioral data usually collected in the context of a planned study or experimentâ€”response time, perceptual judgments, choices, decisions, Likert ratings, eye movements, hours of sleep, etc.

## Multivariate data

Psychological data is often [:multivariate](glossary.qmd#multivariate).
